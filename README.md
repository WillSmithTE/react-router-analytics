## Usage

### Basic Setup

Here's how to set up `react-router-analytics` with React Router:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import { AnalyticsProvider } from "react-router-analytics";
import HomePage from "./pages/HomePage";
import AboutPage from "./pages/AboutPage";

// Example analytics configuration
const analyticsConfig = {
  provider: "google-analytics",
  trackingId: "UA-XXXXXXXXX-X",
};

function App() {
  return (
    <AnalyticsProvider config={analyticsConfig}>
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/" exact component={HomePage} />
          <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
          {/* Add more routes as needed */}
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    </AnalyticsProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Custom Event Tracking

You can also track custom events using the `useAnalytics` hook:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useAnalytics } from "react-router-analytics";

export function CustomButton() {
  const { trackEvent } = useAnalytics();

  const handleClick = () => {
    trackEvent("button_click", {
      category: "User Interaction",
      label: "Custom Button",
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me!</button>;
}
```
